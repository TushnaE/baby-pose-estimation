## pytorch-openpose

pytorch implementation of [openpose](https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose) including **Body and Hand Pose Estimation**, and the pytorch model is directly converted from [openpose](https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose) caffemodel by [caffemodel2pytorch](https://github.com/vadimkantorov/caffemodel2pytorch).

### Getting Started

#### Install Requriements

Create a python 3.7 environement, eg:

    conda create -n pytorch-openpose python=3.7
    conda activate pytorch-openpose

Install pytorch by following the quick start guide here (use pip) https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html

Install other requirements with pip

    pip install -r requirements.txt

#### Download the Models

* [dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/7xbup2qsn7vvjxo/AABWFksdlgOMXR_r5v3RwKRYa?dl=0)

`*.pth` files are pytorch model, you could also download caffemodel file if you want to use caffe as backend.

Download the pytorch models and put them in a directory named `model` in the project root directory

#### Run the Jupyter Notebook
